/**
 * The harness's own guarantee: this tier owns the database while it runs.
 *
 * `resetTables` is a `truncate ... cascade`, and the tier is opt-in against a
 * database a developer names themselves. Nothing stops a second process — a
 * stray `bun run test:db`, an editor task, a CI job sharing one database, another
 * agent in the same checkout — from pointing at it too. When that happened, the
 * other process truncated `users` between a test's seed and its assertions, and
 * the symptom was "failed to create personal organization" thrown from
 * `beforeEach`: an error about auth, on a test about credits, roughly a third of
 * runs, never reproducible in isolation.
 *
 * `vitest.config.mts` solves the same problem *within* a run with `singleFork`.
 * This is the across-runs half, and it is asserted rather than assumed because
 * the failure it prevents is so misleading to debug.
