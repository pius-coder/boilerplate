# Sushi SaaS Starter

A production-minded Next.js backbone for subscription and usage-based SaaS
products. It connects authentication, organizations, Stripe billing, pooled
credits, private storage, durable jobs, internationalization, and a separately
deployed admin console behind one enforced architecture.

This repository is the application starter. Public marketing, guides, and blog
content live on the [Sushi SaaS website](https://www.sushisaas.com), whose
source is maintained in
[PansaLegrand/sushi-saas-site](https://github.com/PansaLegrand/sushi-saas-site),
so content releases never require an application deployment.

## Architecture

Application data flows in one direction:

```text
src/app/**       routes and pages — HTTP in, HTTP out
  ↓
src/services/**  business rules, orchestration, invariants
  ↓
src/models/**    typed CRUD; the only layer allowed to call db()
  ↓
src/db/**        schema, migrations, connection
```

Browser code follows a second explicit boundary:

```text
Server Component  → service directly
Client Component  → src/api/** → shared API client → /api/**
```

`tests/unit/architecture.test.ts` enforces these rules, organization scoping,
error boundaries, client transport conventions, and file naming.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Node.js `>=20.19.0 <23`
- Bun `1.3.14` (exact version from `.bun-version`)
- Docker for the default local PostgreSQL and Redis services

```bash
bun install
bun run setup
bun run dev
```

The application runs on `http://localhost:3000`. Start the admin console in a
second terminal:

```bash
bun run dev:admin
```

The admin app runs on `http://localhost:3001`.

`bun run setup` is idempotent: it creates local secrets only when `.env` does not
exist, starts the development services, and applies migrations.

Bun is the only package manager for this repository. `bun.lock` is the canonical
lockfile and CI installs it with `bun ci`. Do not use npm, pnpm, Yarn, or
Corepack here; Corepack does not install or manage Bun.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` and configure at minimum:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `CRON_SECRET`
- `RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL` and `RATE_LIMIT_IP_SOURCE`
- `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, a locked-down
  `STRIPE_BILLING_PORTAL_CONFIGURATION_ID`, and Stripe Price IDs
- `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM`
- private object-storage credentials

Local auth links are logged when no email provider is configured. Production
validation fails closed when required credentials or anti-abuse controls are
missing.

The application renders an external documentation link only when
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` is set. Point it to the adopting product's own
documentation site; it intentionally has no upstream default. The docs website
is not a submodule and is not built by this repository.

## Temps (optional)

First-party Temps analytics is disabled by default. Configure
`TEMPS_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_SLUG`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPS_API_URL`
together; the key remains server-only and should have only `analytics:write`.
The provider remains production-only and does not mount until the visitor
explicitly accepts analytics cookies. Build the web
and admin artifacts separately with `bun run build:web` and `bun run build:admin`; the
admin artifact contains no browser analytics. See [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md#temps-optional)
for standalone, health, cron, and two-project configuration.

| `bun run db:generate`     | Generate a Drizzle migration                                     |
| `bun run db:migrate`      | Apply local migrations                                           |

| `bun run db:migrate:prod` | Apply production migrations under an advisory lock               |

## Engineering documentation

The root `docs/` directory contains co-versioned operational runbooks—not the
public website:

- [Database and ledger invariants](docs/database.md)
- [Plans and entitlements](docs/plans.md)
- [Organizations and authorization](docs/organizations.md)
- [Error handling contract](docs/errors.md)
- [Storage providers](docs/storage-providers.md)
- [African regional baseline](docs/african-baseline.md)
- [Release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md)
- [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Test strategy](tests/README.md)
- [Admin deployment](apps/admin/README.md)

Behavior changes should update these runbooks in the same pull request. Public
guides should be changed in the detached documentation repository and linked
from the PR.

## Production responsibility

The starter supplies technical controls; it cannot choose product policy for
you. Before launch, complete the legal placeholders, decide retention and
account-erasure behavior, configure backups and restore drills, enforce CSP
after observing reports, protect the default branch, and run the manual Stripe,
auth, storage, and email checks in `docs/release-checklist.md`.
