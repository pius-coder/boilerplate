# Database Reference

The schema in [src/db/schema.ts](../src/db/schema.ts) is the single source of truth — 24 tables, no
hand-written SQL. This document explains what each table is for, the rules that
hold across all of them, and what to do when you change one.

Related: [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for migrations and environments, [tests/README.md](../tests/README.md) for the
database test tier that pins the invariants below.

## Setting up from a fresh clone

You need **two databases**: one for the app, one for the tests. They must be
separate — the test tier runs `TRUNCATE` before every test, so if it shared your
dev database it would erase your data on every `bun run test:db`.

| Database     | Env var             | Purpose                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `sushi_dev`  | `DATABASE_URL`      | What `bun run dev` reads and writes               |
| `sushi_test` | `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Wiped constantly. Holds nothing you care about |

Both live on the **same** Postgres server — same host, same port, same
credentials. Only the database name at the end of the URL differs.

### If you have no Postgres yet

```bash
bun install && bun run setup
```

That writes `.env` with generated secrets, starts Postgres 16 in Docker, creates
both databases, and migrates them. Then `bun run dev`.

### If you already have Postgres running

Very common — and `bun run setup` detects it and stops rather than fighting for port 5432. Create the two databases on the server you already have:

```bash
createdb sushi_dev && createdb sushi_test
```

If it runs in a container, go through it instead:

```bash
docker exec <container-name> psql -U postgres -c "create database sushi_dev;" -c "create database sushi_test;"
```

Put both URLs in `.env`, matching your server's user, password, and port:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/sushi_dev
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/sushi_test
```

Then apply the schema to each:

```bash
bun run db:migrate && bun run test:db:setup
```

### Confirm it worked

```bash
bun run test:db
```

23 tests should pass. If they **skip** instead, `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is not being
picked up — check it is in `.env` and that its database name contains `test`,
which the harness requires before it will truncate anything.

### Production

Bring your own database — any managed Postgres. Create it, set `DATABASE_URL`,
and run the migration workflow. Never set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` there. Details in
[DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Ground rules

These are the non-obvious decisions. Break one and something downstream breaks
quietly.

### 1. There are no foreign keys

Not one table declares a foreign key. Relationships are plain `varchar` columns
holding a `user_uuid`, `order_no`, or `service_id`.

The consequences are real and you must code around them:

- **No cascade deletes.** Deleting a user leaves their credits, files, tasks,
  and reservations behind. Any deletion flow has to clean up explicitly.
- **No referential integrity.** Nothing stops a row pointing at a `user_uuid`
  that does not exist. Validate in the service layer.
- **Orphans are possible.** Budget for a reconciliation query, not a constraint.

This is a deliberate trade — Better Auth owns the `users` table lifecycle, and
the app tables are loosely coupled to it — but it is the single most important
thing to know before writing a delete path.

### 2. `uuid` is the identity, never `email`, rarely `id`

`users` carries two identifiers:

| Column | Owner       | Use                                               |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`   | Better Auth | Session lookups only                              |
| `uuid` | The app     | Everything else — every other table joins on this |

**Never resolve a user by email.** `users.email` is unique only _per
`signin_provider`_, so one address can legitimately have two rows. An email
lookup can return a different account than the session's — which, in an
authorization path, is an account takeover. `apps/admin/lib/authz.ts` resolves
roles strictly from the session uuid/id for exactly this reason.

### 3. The credit ledger is append-only

`credits` rows are immutable facts. Balance is `SUM(credits)` over the
organization's rows — grants positive, spends negative. There is no balance
column, and **nothing may `UPDATE` or `DELETE` a credits row.** A correction is a
new compensating row (see `refundCreditsForTransaction`).

`auth_events` and `admin_audit_logs` follow the same rule: append-only, never
edited.

**Three audit columns, added in `0018`, and two traps in them:**

| Column          | Holds                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `balance_after` | The running total of every row for the org, this one included                     |
| `actor`         | Who caused it: `stripe:webhook`, `admin:<uuid>`, `user:<uuid>`, `system:<reason>` |
| `metadata_json` | Free-form JSON — the task a spend paid for, the transaction a refund reverses     |

The first trap: **`balance_after` is not the spendable balance.** Credits expire
without writing a ledger row, so a spend-aware figure would drift from the sum by
design and a reconciliation script could not tell that apart from real
corruption. `balance_after` tracks the ledger total; `getOrgCredits` computes
what can actually be spent. They are allowed to disagree, and usually do.

The second: **`actor` is not `user_uuid`.** `user_uuid` is who the movement is
credited _to_; `actor` is who caused it. On an admin grant they are two different
people, which is the entire reason the column exists.

Both are only correct when written under the per-organization advisory lock, so
`src/models/credit.ts` owns every write and its insert type refuses a
caller-supplied `balance_after`. Do not insert into `credits` from anywhere else.
A null in any of the three means "written before `0018`", which a script must
treat as out of scope rather than as drift.
**Spends use FEFO (first-expiring, first-out).** The active grant with the
nearest `expired_at` is consumed first; grants sharing an expiration use oldest
grant first, and grants that never expire come last. If one logical spend crosses
two expiration/order buckets, it is inserted atomically as two negative ledger
rows. The first row keeps the transaction number returned to the caller; later
parts use deterministic `:part:<n>` suffixes. Private `__credit_fefo` metadata on
the group names every part, so a refund can restore all buckets atomically and
idempotently while tasks continue to store one stable transaction number.
Customer ledger DTOs collapse those physical parts back into one movement
before applying the page limit, report the full logical amount under the root
transaction number, and never serialize the private grouping metadata. Admin
audit views intentionally retain every physical part and its metadata.
`findCreditByTransNo` follows the customer/logical meaning even when given a
child part id; refund reconstruction uses a private physical lookup instead.

Each debit part inherits the expiration and `order_no` of the grant bucket it
consumed. When that grant expires, its matching debit expires with it; credits
remaining in a later bucket do not disappear. Refund parts inherit the same
bucket terms, so a refund restores the original credits rather than minting a
new never-expiring grant.

Balance reads replay the immutable ledger through the same FEFO allocator used
by the spend guard. This is deliberate compatibility behavior: older versions
wrote one debit against only the last bucket a spend touched, and trusting that
single `expired_at` would continue to misstate historical balances. Summary
fields therefore mean:

- `balance`: credits spendable now
- `granted`: face value of positive rows still active now
- `consumed`: active grant value already used (`granted - balance`)
- `expired`: unused credits that actually reached expiration, not the face
  value of grants already consumed
- `expiringSoon`: the remaining amount in each soon-expiring grant bucket

### 4. Idempotency lives in unique indexes, not in code

Every "must happen exactly once" guarantee is a database constraint. The code
catches the resulting `23505` and treats it as success. Full map:

| Constraint                                                      | Protects against                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `credits.trans_no` unique                                       | Double-granting signup credits, double-refunding                                                       |
| `jobs.dedupe_key` unique                                        | Two welcome emails from one retried signup                                                             |
| `tasks (user_uuid, type, idempotency_key)` unique               | Double-charging for a double-clicked task                                                              |
| `stripe_webhook_events.event_id` unique                         | Reprocessing a Stripe retry                                                                            |
| `subscriptions.stripe_subscription_id` unique                   | Two rows for one Stripe subscription. Nullable, so comps (many NULLs) do not collide                   |
| `orders.order_no` unique                                        | Reusing one order identifier                                                                           |
| `orders (org_uuid, checkout_intent_id)` unique                  | Two orders from one checkout double-click or retry. A new intent id still creates another subscription |
| `reservations.reservation_no` unique                            | Duplicate bookings                                                                                     |
| `reservations (org_uuid, user_uuid, checkout_intent_id)` unique | Two bookings from one browser reservation intent                                                       |
| `reservations.order_no` unique (non-null rows)                  | Attaching one paid order to two bookings                                                               |
| `files (bucket, key)` unique                                    | Two rows for one object                                                                                |
| `users (email, signin_provider)` unique                         | One address claimed twice per provider                                                                 |

If you remove or weaken one of these, the catch blocks that depend on it turn
into silent double-effects. `tests/db/` exists to make that impossible to do
accidentally.

### 5. Money is integer minor units

`orders.amount`, `reservation_services.price`, and `deposit_amount` are **cents**
(or the currency's minor unit), always `integer`. Never a float, never a decimal
string. Divide only at the display edge.

Credits are a separate unit with no fixed currency value — do not conflate them.

### 6. Reservation overlap is a database invariant

Migration `0025` installs PostgreSQL's `btree_gist` extension and an exclusion
constraint over each service's half-open
`tstzrange(blocked_start_at, blocked_end_at, '[)')`. Pending and confirmed
bookings cannot overlap even if a future writer bypasses the service lock.
`blocked_*` includes the buffer snapshot, while `start_at` / `end_at` remain the
time shown to the customer.

The migration deliberately does not guess how to repair pre-existing invalid or
overlapping reservations. Before applying it to a database with reservation
data, verify that active ranges do not overlap and that the database role may
install `btree_gist`. If either condition is false, stop the migration and
resolve the data or extension permission explicitly; do not silently discard a
customer booking.

An elapsed hold with no persisted Stripe Session can be expired under the same
per-service advisory lock that claims the next booking. Once a Session id is
stored, only a signed `checkout.session.expired` or
`checkout.session.async_payment_failed` webhook releases the range.
That deliberately favors holding a slot too long during a webhook outage over
selling it while Stripe can still accept the earlier payment.

### 7. Stripe period columns are Unix seconds, not timestamps

`orders.sub_period_start`, `sub_period_end`, and `sub_cycle_anchor` are
`integer`, holding epoch seconds exactly as Stripe sends them. Everything else
in the schema is `timestamptz`. Do not "fix" these to timestamps without
migrating the values.

`subscriptions` is the exception that proves the rule: it stores the same
instants as `timestamptz`, because they are read on every entitlement check and
comparing epoch integers at each one is how a timezone bug gets in.

### 8. State copied from a webhook records the event's timestamp

`subscriptions.stripe_event_at` holds the moment Stripe _emitted_ the event the
row was written from, not the moment we received it. Deliveries are retried for
days and arrive out of order, so the upsert compares this column and drops
anything older. Without it, a delayed `customer.subscription.updated` landing
after the `deleted` that followed it resurrects a cancelled subscription — the
user keeps a paid tier they no longer pay for, and nothing in the logs looks
wrong. Any future table that mirrors external state needs the same column.

### 9. Affiliate deduplication preserves the removed facts

Migrations `0023` and `0024` install the two affiliate uniqueness constraints.
Historical webhook or signup races can leave more than one row for the same
logical fact, so the migrations keep the lowest `affiliates.id` as the active
canonical row. Every other row is copied to
`affiliate_deduplication_archive` before it is removed from `affiliates`.

The archive is evidence, not application state:

- `original_affiliate_id` identifies the removed row and
  `canonical_affiliate_id` identifies the row that won.
- `reason` is `duplicate_paid_order_no` or
  `duplicate_signup_attribution`.
- `original_row_json` is the complete pre-cleanup affiliate row, serialized as
  JSON text; `archived_at` records when the migration made the decision.
- The unique `(original_affiliate_id, reason)` index makes replaying an archive
  insert harmless. There is deliberately no foreign key: the evidence must
  remain readable even if the active row is later retained, anonymized, or
  removed under policy.

Do not update or delete archive rows in normal application code. The one
deliberate update is account erasure: it replaces matching `user_uuid` and
`invited_by` values inside `original_row_json` with the account's irreversible
erasure id while preserving amounts, order references, status, and the
deduplication decision. Subject-access exports include matching archive rows.
Migration `0028` creates the same table with `IF NOT EXISTS` for development or
pre-release databases that ran an earlier form of `0023`/`0024`; on a fresh
install it is a no-op.
`0028` cannot reconstruct a row that an older migration already deleted. If
that earlier form ever ran against data that must be retained, recover the
removed rows from the database backup and import them into the archive before
calling the migration complete. The strict migration checker will also report
the changed `0023`/`0024` hashes on such a database. Recreate disposable
pre-release databases; for a data-bearing environment, preserve the database,
recover the evidence, and follow the migration-drift response in
`DEPLOYMENT.md` rather than weakening checksum validation.

### Auth — owned by Better Auth

| Table             | Purpose                                          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `users`           | Accounts                                         | Dual id (`id`/`uuid`). `role` is `user` / `admin_ro` / `admin_rw`. `last_signin_at` is denormalized from `auth_events`. `banned_at` non-null is a suspension — a timestamp rather than a boolean pair, and a re-ban never overwrites the first one (the UPDATE carries `WHERE banned_at IS NULL`). Renaming a column here means updating `src/lib/auth.ts` field mapping.                                                                          |
| `email_blocklist` | Addresses and domains barred from signing up     | Enforced in the `user.create.before` hook, so it covers **OAuth signup too** — the path with no captcha in front of it. `scope` is `email` / `domain`; `value` is the _normalized_ key from `src/lib/email-address.ts` (plus-suffix stripped everywhere, dots stripped for Gmail), never raw input. Unique on `(scope, value)` so a re-block is a no-op. `expires_at` null means permanent; an expired row stops matching but stays for the trail. |
| `sessions`        | Live sessions                                    | Deleted on sign-out and expiry — cannot be used as a log. Also deleted deliberately by a ban: that is what makes a suspension take effect now rather than at cookie expiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `accounts`        | Provider linkage + password hash                 | Unique on `(provider_id, account_id)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `orders`                | Purchases — the immutable financial log            | `status` is `created` / paid states. Browser checkouts are idempotent on `(org_uuid, checkout_intent_id)`; `checkout_fingerprint` refuses the same key with different terms, while `stripe_price_id` and `checkout_locale` preserve the exact Stripe request across a crash. Subscription period columns are epoch seconds. Never rewritten after the fact; do not answer "what is this user entitled to" from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `subscriptions`         | Current billing state, one row per subscription    | What `orders` is not: rewritten in place on every Stripe event. `status` uses Stripe's own vocabulary. `source` is `stripe` or `manual` (a comp). `stripe_event_at` orders concurrent webhook deliveries (ground rule 7). Read through `src/services/entitlements.ts`, never directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `credits`               | Append-only ledger                                 | Positive = grant, negative = spend. `expired_at` null means never expires. `trans_type` values are the `CreditsTransType` enum in `src/services/credit.ts`. `balance_after` / `actor` / `metadata_json` are the audit columns — see ground rule 3, including the two traps in them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `stripe_webhook_events` | Webhook idempotency + retry state, and the receipt | `status` is `processing` / `completed` / `failed` / `action_required`; `attempts` counts retries. **`action_required` is not a failure** — it is a permanent condition needing a human (an unmapped price), answered with a 200 so Stripe stops retrying, with the reason in `last_error`. `failed` retries automatically; `action_required` is reclaimable only by a deliberate replay. `payload` is the record of truth; the `stripe_*` id columns, `livemode`, `api_version`, and `request_id` are denormalized out of it at write time by `src/services/stripe/receipt.ts`, because a `text` column cannot answer "every event for this subscription" without a full scan. Indexed by customer, invoice, and subscription. Nulls are normal: no single event carries every id. |

### Storage & usage

| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `files` | S3/R2 object metadata | Lifecycle `uploading` → `active` → `deleted`. **Soft delete**: set `status='deleted'` and `deleted_at`; the row stays. Tenant ownership is `org_uuid`; the older `org_id` column is legacy and should not be used for authorization. |
| `tasks` | AI/usage work records | `credits_trans_no` traces the exact ledger row that paid for it. Idempotent per `(user_uuid, type, idempotency_key)`.                                                                                                                |

| `jobs`             | Durable queue drained by `/api/cron/jobs` | Claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. `locked_at` allows reclaiming a job whose runner died. Backoff via `run_at`. `dedupe_key` is nullable and NULLs stay distinct, so un-deduped jobs are unaffected. |
| `admin_audit_logs` | Append-only admin action trail            | `actor_email` is denormalized so the trail survives user edits. Every admin write must call `writeAdminAuditLog()`.                                                                                      |

### Retired scaffolding

Migration `0026` removes the unfinished `posts` and `apikeys` tables. Neither
had an application route or service, and public editorial content now belongs
to the detached documentation-site repository. A future API-key feature must be
designed as a complete security boundary—hashed credentials, scopes, rotation,
revocation, and audit logging—rather than reviving the raw-key scaffold.

The drop is intentionally destructive. An existing deployment that used either
table outside this starter must back up and migrate that data before applying
`0026`.

## Conventions

| Concern            | Rule                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Table names        | Plural snake_case (`auth_events`, `reservation_services`)                                                   |
| Column names       | snake_case, including in TypeScript — the Drizzle model mirrors SQL exactly                                 |
| Index names        | `<table>_<columns>_idx`, or `_unique_idx` for unique                                                        |
| Primary keys       | `integer().primaryKey().generatedAlwaysAsIdentity()` for app tables; `varchar` for Better Auth tables       |
| Public identifiers | A separate `uuid` column, unique. Never expose the integer `id` in an API                                   |
| Timestamps         | `timestamp({ withTimezone: true })` — always. No naked `timestamp`                                          |
| `updated_at`       | Set by application code. **There is no trigger.** If you write a row and skip it, it goes stale             |
| Status columns     | `varchar` with allowed values in a comment, not a Postgres enum — cheaper to extend. Validate in TypeScript |
| Text               | `varchar({length})` when bounded, `text()` when not. JSON blobs are `text()` with a `_json` suffix          |
| Booleans           | `.notNull().default(...)` — avoid nullable booleans                                                         |

### Where code for a table lives

```
src/db/schema.ts       table definition
src/models/<domain>.ts typed CRUD helpers — the ONLY place raw queries belong
src/services/*.ts      orchestration; calls models, never db() directly
src/app/api/**         routes; call services, never models directly
```

Routes reaching past services into models, or services calling `db()` directly,
is the drift to watch for in review.

---

## Changing the schema

```bash
bun run db:generate    # after editing src/db/schema.ts
bun run db:migrate     # apply locally
```

Commit the generated `.sql` **and** `meta/_journal.json`. Never edit an applied
migration file — write a new one.

### Checklist for every schema change

- [ ] Edited `src/db/schema.ts`, not SQL by hand
- [ ] Ran `bun run db:generate`; reviewed the generated SQL before committing
- [ ] **Expand/contract safe** — the currently deployed code still works against the new schema ([DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md#expand--contract))
- [ ] Added a `src/models/<domain>.ts` helper rather than querying from a service or route
- [ ] Added an index for any column you filter or sort by at scale
- [ ] If you added a uniqueness guarantee, added a `tests/db/` test that proves it rejects a duplicate
- [ ] If you renamed a `users` column, updated the field mapping in `src/lib/auth.ts`
- [ ] Ran `bun run test:db` against `sushi_test`

### Adding a table — the full path

1. Define it in `src/db/schema.ts` with the conventions above
2. `bun run db:generate`
3. Add `src/models/<domain>.ts` with typed helpers
4. Call from `src/services/*`, then from a route
5. Add a route auth-gate test and, if the table carries an invariant, a `tests/db/` test
6. Add the table to this document

## Known issues — what to do later

Ordered by how much they will hurt.

1. **No foreign keys anywhere.** Adding them is an expand/contract job per table
   and needs an orphan sweep first. Highest-value fix, since it turns a class of
   silent data corruption into a loud error. Start with `credits.user_uuid` and
   `tasks.user_uuid`.

2. **`created_at` nullability is inconsistent.** Newer tables use
   `.notNull().defaultNow()`; older ones (`orders`, `credits`, `affiliates`,
   `feedbacks`) are nullable and set from application
   code. That means a forgotten field yields a null timestamp and breaks
   ordering. Backfill and tighten. **Do not copy the old pattern into new
   tables.**

3. **`files.org_id` is legacy.** Tenancy now uses `org_uuid` across application
   tables. `files.org_id` remains as an older placeholder column and should be
   dropped in a contract migration once no deployed code can reference it.

4. **No committed retention period for the audit tables.** Finished `jobs` are
   pruned after 14 days, while `auth_events` and `admin_audit_logs` remain
   append-only. Decide their retention before they are large enough that
   deleting or repartitioning them requires a maintenance window.

5. ~~**`getSnowId()` collides across instances.**~~ **Fixed.** It seeded
   `credits.trans_no` and `orders.order_no` from `SNOWFLAKE_WORKER_ID`, which
   defaulted to `1` on every serverless instance, so two concurrent lambdas in one
   millisecond minted the same id. The unique index made that a failed insert
   rather than a corrupted ledger — but a user-visible one, mid-checkout, at
   exactly the traffic levels that produce concurrency.

   Record ids now come from `newId()` in `src/lib/ids.ts` (UUIDv7: a millisecond
   timestamp plus 74 random bits, no worker id to forget to set). **Existing rows
   keep their numeric ids** and nothing was backfilled — these columns are opaque
   `varchar` keys and nothing parses or sorts them numerically, which was checked
   before the change. Expect both shapes side by side, plus the
   `renewal:<sub>:<period>` form that migration-era Stripe renewals write.

6. **Some status columns have no CHECK constraints.** Reservations and privacy
   requests are constrained in PostgreSQL, but several older tables still rely
   on TypeScript validation. A bad direct `UPDATE` can write an unsupported
   state. Add constraints through expand/contract migrations as those tables
   change.

## Raw SQL and `db().execute()`

Almost every query goes through Drizzle's query builder, which converts
JavaScript values to Postgres types for you. One place does not:
`claimDueJobs` in `src/models/job.ts` uses a raw `sql` template because
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` has no builder equivalent.

**`db().execute()` sends the statement down postgres.js's unsafe path, which has
no type handler for `Date`.** Passing one throws:

```
The "string" argument must be of type string or an instance of Buffer or
ArrayBuffer. Received an instance of Date
```

This is not a compile error and not something a mocked test can see — it
silently broke the entire job queue until `tests/db/jobs.queue.test.ts` ran
against a real database for the first time. Since nothing drained the `jobs`
table, no welcome email and no signup credit grant would ever have been
delivered in production.

If you write raw SQL, convert values yourself:

```ts
const nowIso = new Date().toISOString();
sql`... where run_at <= ${nowIso}::timestamptz`;
```

Always add a `tests/db/` test alongside raw SQL. It is the only tier that
executes the statement.
