# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve the starter. Changes should preserve its central
promise: a clean checkout is secure by default, understandable without private
context, and safe to adapt into a real product.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues and pull requests before opening a duplicate.
- Use an issue to discuss large schema, authentication, billing, or architecture
  changes before investing in an implementation.
- Never include credentials, customer data, production logs, or private URLs in
  an issue, fixture, screenshot, or commit.
- Read `AGENTS.md` for the layer rules, `docs/errors.md` before adding an error
  path, `docs/database.md` before changing the schema, and `tests/README.md`
  before adding tests.

## Local setup

Requirements:

- Node.js 20.19 or newer, below Node.js 23
- Bun 1.3.14
- Docker, or local PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7 instances

Bootstrap a fresh checkout:

```bash
bun ci
bun run setup
bun run dev
```

`bun run setup` creates local-only secrets, starts the development services, and
applies migrations. It never overwrites an existing `.env`.

## Making a change

1. Branch from the current default branch.
2. Keep the change focused. Avoid drive-by formatting or dependency churn.
3. Follow the one-way architecture:

   ```text
   app routes → services → models → database
   ```

4. Add a regression test for a bug and tests at the lowest tier that proves a
   new invariant.
5. For money or credit mutations, add a replay test. For routes, add an
   authentication-gate test that proves data functions were not called.
6. For schema changes, commit the generated SQL and Drizzle metadata together.
   Migrations must be expand/contract safe.
7. Update co-versioned engineering documentation when behavior, configuration,
   or deployment steps change.

## Validation

Run the same core gates as CI:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run test:cov
bun run build
```

The real-database tier requires `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and `TEST_REDIS_URL`:

```bash
bun run test:db:setup
bun run test:db
```

Do not lower coverage thresholds to make a build green.

## Commits and pull requests

- Use Conventional Commit subjects such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
  `refactor:`, or `chore:`.
- Explain why the change is necessary, not only what files changed.
- Call out migrations, new environment variables, security implications, and
  backward-compatibility constraints.
- Include screenshots for visible UI changes.
- Keep generated files in the same commit as the source change that generated
  them.
